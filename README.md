PHP Prime Number Generator
======================

This was spawned from a Seattle PHP meetup I attended where we were presented with the challenge to generate as many prime numbers within one minute. I wrote an article on this as well which you can find [here](http://pixel-zombie.com/prime-number-generator/), detailing the research and development process behind it to bring it to its full potential.
